## **Welcome!**

This site contains the materials for the University of Washington's CLAS 205: Bioscientific Vocabulary Building from Latin and Greek. This course is designed to help students master the scientific vocabulary of their particular field by a study of the Latin and Greek roots that are used to create the majority of scientific terms. In addition, students will explore science and medicine in the Ancient Mediterranean, as well as how the Greco-Roman scientific tradition has contributed to modern methods of scientific inquiry and theory.

## Course Goals

This course has four main objectives:

- To **improve understanding of bioscientific vocabulary** through pattern recognition and practice with word formation
- To **give familiarity with Greek and Latin stems and their meanings** for the facilitated identification and interpretation of new terms
- To **introduce high-level concepts** relating to the Greek and Latin languages and to the role that the Ancient Mediterranean has played in shaping modern science
- To **provide a framework** for discussing and interpreting scientific topics and technical jargon

To achieve these goals, the course is structured around four topic areas, each with its own project. In addition, there are reading and reflection questions at the end of each lesson to help students practice vocabulary. Since this is a course that relies heavily on memorization and regular practice with the course concepts, it is recommended that students create their own review or mnemonic devices (e.g., flashcards, charts).

## How to Use This Site

The heart of this site is the Textbook, which can be accessed at the left sidebar. The book is divided into four units, which are further subdivided into lessons. Each unit is themed around a particular application of Greek and Latin stems in science. Each lesson contains some readings, a vocabulary list, and some practice problems. Though there is a vocabulary index that students can use, it is recommended that students memorize as much vocabulary as they can, or keep their own notes.

Note that since this book was designed specifically with the asynchronous, remote version of the course in mind, it has some limitations. Namely, there are no solutions to the practice problems or projects. As this project expands, I hope to enhance the reading experience and provide more interactive opportunities.
