# Project 3: Exploring the Universe 🚀
{: .no_toc}

## Objectives
{: .no_toc}

1. Connect understanding of Greek and Latin naming conventions to the names of astronomical objects
2. Explore non-classical etymologies for stars
3. Learn about ancient perspectives on cosmology and astronomy

## Relevance
{: .no_toc}

In this project, you will explore the names of astronomical objects such as moons, planets, and stars. Many objects in our solar system and universe have names originating from the classical tradition, but many do not! In addition, you will read some excerpts from Greek and Roman writers about their understanding of the universe. As you work through this project, consider the ways in which the classical tradition has informed the way we think about the universe, and how those perspectives might have changed over time.

## 📚 Problem 1: Down by the Bayer

For each of the following groups of stars, use their Bayer designations (i.e., their Greek letters) to order the stars from brightest to dimmest. (Note: Bayer's observations were calculated solely on observations with the naked eye and may not necessarily reflect the true luminosities of the stars when calculated through modern methods.)

1. δ Orionis, β Orionis, α Orionis, ε Orionis
2. ε Canis Majoris, ο Canis Majoris, δ Canis Majoris, η Canis Majoris
3. π Pegasi, φ Pegasi, ξ Pegasi, γ Pegasi
4. ψ Draconis, δ Draconis, ζ Draconis, η Draconis
5. κ Ophiuchi, θ Ophiuchi, ν Ophiuchi, χ Ophiuchi

## 🔎 Problem 2: Moonwalking

For each of the following planets, look up and provide the names of at least four of their moons. Then tell what the names of the moons have in common. Are the moon names related to the name of their planet? Why or why not?

1. Jupiter
2. Saturn
3. Uranus
4. Neptune

## 🔎 Problem 3: Probing for Answers

Look up and give the destination for each solar system probe series. Then tell how its name is related to its destination.

1. Venera
2. Juno
3. Helios
4. Phobos
5. Luna

## 🔎 Problem 4: The Best and Brightest

For each of the following constellations, give the proper name of the constellation's brightest star (i.e., not its Bayer designation). Then look up and give the etymology of that star's name. Include the language of origin, the meaning of the star's name, and how it relates (or doesn't relate!) to the constellation itself.

1. Hydra
2. Cygnus
3. Taurus
4. Lyra
5. Capricorn
6. Ursa Major
7. Aquila
8. Eridanus

## 🔎 Problem 5: Astrologic

In an essay of about 200-300 words, compare and contrast the Babylonian, Chinese, Hindu, and Hellenistic zodiacs. Include the following in your essay.

- What are the key similarities and differences between these systems in terms of their structure or symbolic meanings?
- How does each system interpret the significance of planets and/or constellations?
- The word *zodiac* comes from the Greek root *zo* meaning "animal". Do you find the term "zodiac" appropriate for each system?

## Problem 6: Lost in the Cosmos

Read the following excerpts (in English!) from ancient literature describing the nature of astronomy and the universe:

- [*Astronomica* by Manilius, Book 1, lines 118-254](https://www-loebclassics-com.offcampus.lib.washington.edu/view/manilius-astronomica/1977/pb_LCL469.15.xml?result=1&rskey=gQXCeC)
- [*On Astrology* by Lucian, sections 17-21](https://www-loebclassics-com.offcampus.lib.washington.edu/view/lucian-astrology/1936/pb_LCL302.361.xml)
- [*On the Nature of Things* by Lucretius, Book 5, lines 416-533](https://www-loebclassics-com.offcampus.lib.washington.edu/view/lucretius-de_rerum_natura/1924/pb_LCL181.411.xml)

In an essay of about 300-400 words, compare and contrast the way these writers describe the origins of the universe and how they speak about the purpose or conceptualization of astronomy. Compare these with modern notions of how the universe began. What is similar, and what is different?

## Challenge Problem: The Root of the Issue

For any of the texts in Problem 6, read either the Latin or the Greek and identify 5 words that contain roots that you've learned so far. Give the word, the root, and the context (i.e., the sentence or the line you found the word in). What do you think each word means?

**Example:** In the line *Arma virumque cano, Troiae qui primus ab oris*, the word *primus* contains the root "prim", meaning "first". Since the line translates to "I sing of arms and the man, the first from the shores of Troy", *primus* probably means "first" (person).
