## Objectives

1. Become familiar with the Latin language for medical and anatomical terminology
2. Recognize how Latin roots appear in their original forms
3. Be able to translate simple Latin phrases

## Inflecting Nouns

As we saw back in Lesson 3, Latin is an **inflected language**, which means that the spellings of certain words change depending on how they're used in a sentence. Now, this lesson is not intended to be a crash course in Latin (there are better courses for that). Rather, it should introduce you to the way that Latin nouns are formed and used in preparation for looking at anatomical and medical terms that retain Latin in its original forms instead of through Anglicization. Inflection is not exclusive to Latin, but it's quite different from English. The important thing to remember is that there *is* a pattern to how Latin nouns are formed and used.

Nouns have four properties, which affect how their spellings change. These are **gender**, **number**, **case**, and **declension**.

## Gender

**Gender** in Latin is purely grammatical, which means that it doesn’t necessarily describe the gender of the noun itself. This is different from English, which sometimes genders nouns according to what they describe. For example, a *hen* is female, and a *rooster* is male, even though these are both words for a chicken. However, if we were thinking about an inanimate object like a table or a chair, it's hard to conceptualize whether these items can have genders attached to them in English. Gender in Latin more closely describes a noun's grammatical function, purpose, or the way that it interacts with other modifiers in the language. The Latin language has three genders: **feminine, masculine, and neuter**.

{: .note}
> English doesn't have gendered nouns, but if you're familiar with other European languages, many of them have their own gender systems when it comes to nouns. For example, Danish has a common and neuter gender, French has a masculine and feminine gender, and German has masculine, feminine, and neuter.

## Number

**Number** refers to how many of the nouns there are. There are two possible numbers in Latin, which are the singular or the plural (one or many). The most common way to form plurals in English is to add an 'S' at the end of the word, but there are some exceptions as well. For example, the plural of *goose* is *geese* and the plural of *mouse* is *mice*.

## Case

The next property is the **case**, which refers to how the noun is used in a sentence. Latin actually has seven different cases for ways that nouns can be used, but we're just going to focus on five. The following chart shows the cases that we'll work with, their English equivalents, and where you might see them.

| Case          | English equivalent    | Context                           |
| :---          | :---                  | :---                              |
| Nominative    | subject               | noun phrases, subject of sentence |
| Genitive      | possessive            | often with nominatives in phrases |
| Dative        | indirect object       | indicating "to whom/what" or "for whom/what" |
| Accusative    | direct object, object of prepositions | often object of prepositions |
| Ablative      | object of prepositions | often in prepositional phrases   |

{: .note}
> If you're familiar with Latin or study it at a more advanced level, you will note that this chart gives an oversimplification of the uses of the non-nominatives cases. For the purposes of this class, these are the contexts in which you will see these cases.

For many Latin words retaining their original forms, the dative and ablative will look identical. The way you can tell the difference is that the ablative follows prepositions, whereas the dative does not. Here is a list of Latin prepositions, along with whether they are followed by a word in the accusative case or the ablative case.

| Latin preposition | English definition | Accusative   | Ablative  | Example   |
| :---              | :---               | :---:        | :---:     | :---      |
| ab/a              | from, away from    |              | x         | a priori  |
| cum               | with               |              | x         | cum laude |
| de                | away from, down from, concerning | | x        | de facto  |
| ex/e              | out of, away from  |              | x         | ex animo  |
| sine              | without            |              | x         | sine modo |
| in*               | in/on, into/onto   | x            | x         | in situ, in memoriam |
| post              | after              | x            |           | post mortem |

## Declension

The final property that Latin nouns have is **declension**. Latin nouns, like their English counterparts, comprise a **root** and an **ending**. The ending is the part that changes, while the root remains fixed. A declension is like a formula for the type of spelling changes that will occur for a noun's endings. There are five total declensions in Latin. Here are the paradigms for each. 

A lot of the spellings will unfortunately look identical. The most important thing to consider is the context in which you're translating. The most common cases used in medical terminology are the **nominative** and **genitive** cases, so more often than not, those are the two that you'll see. The dative is rarely used, and the accusative and ablative are usually found with **prepositions**.

In summary, these are the cases and numbers that are the most common. The charts that follow are solely for your reference.

- Nominative singular
- Nominative plural
- Genitive singular
- Genitive plural
- Accusative singular
- Ablative singular

### First Declension Nouns

All first-declension nouns that you will see in this class are feminine. (There exist some masculine first-declension nouns, but these are not relevant to our class.)

#### Singular

| Case              | Ending        | Example       | Translation               |
| :---              | :---          | :---          | :---                      |
| Nominative        | -a            | aqua          | water                     |
| Genitive          | -ae           | aquae         | of (the) water, water's   |
| Dative            | -ae           | aquae         | to/for (the) water        |
| Accusative        | -am           | aquam         | water (object)            |
| Ablative          | -a            | aqua          | water (prepositional object) |

#### Plural

| Case              | Ending        | Example       | Translation               |
| :---              | :---          | :---          | :---                      |
| Nominative        | -ae           | aquae         | waters (subject)          |
| Genitive          | -arum         | aquarum       | of (the) waters, waters'  |
| Dative            | -is           | aquis         | to/for (the) waters       |
| Accusative        | -as           | aquas         | waters (object)           |
| Ablative          | -is           | aquis         | waters (prepositional object) |

### Second-Declension Nouns

Second-declension nouns are masculine (-us) or neuter (-um). They differ only in their nominative and accusative forms, which is how you can tell the genders apart. Note that a noun will only ever have one gender and declension, even though its number and case may change depending on its use in a sentence or phrase.

### Third-Declension Nouns

Third declension nouns are an odd mix. Because their nominative forms vary (including but not limited to such words as *ren*, *caput*, *lumen*, *tumor*, and *os*), the roots are more easily seen in the genitive forms. (This is actually true for nouns of any declension&mdash; the rest of the paradigm is determined from the spelling of the genitive.)

There's one further complication with third-declension nouns, called i-stems. This is usually seen more in the plural forms of some third-declension nouns, which have an extra i in their spellings (hence the name, i-stem). You will not need to memorize which nouns are i-stems or not&mdash; any i-stem third-declension nouns will be marked with an asterisk (*) in the charts.

Nouns in this declension can be masculine, feminine, or neuter. Masculine and feminine nouns follow the same paradigm, but neuters are slightly different. Multiple examples are given here for the sake of illustration.

### Fifth-Declension Nouns

Fifth-declension nouns are also rare. These nouns are usually masculine or feminine (neuter fifth-declension nouns exist, but they're not relevant to this class). Masculine and feminine nouns follow the same paradigm, so they're listed in the same charts below.

#### Singular

| Case              | Ending        | Example       | Translation               |
| :---              | :---          | :---          | :---                      |

| Ablative          | -ebus           | faciebus         | faces (prepositional object) |

## Adjectives

In English, the spelling of the adjective doesn't actually change depending on the noun it modifies. The example I gave was saying the phrase “the blue dog”, where “dog” is singular, and “the blue dogs”, where “dogs" is plural. The word “blue” doesn't change between both phrases.

However, in Latin, adjectives have to agree with their modified nouns in gender, number, and case. So for example “the blue dog” (it's hard to demonstrate gender and case in English, but we can still demonstrate the number), “the blue dog” in the plural would have to become “the blues dogs” for the adjective to change its form to agree with its noun.

The properties of nouns&mdash; number, gender, case, and declension&mdash; all apply to adjectives as well. The same divisons of number, gender, and case all apply to Latin adjectives, but their declensions work a little differently. There are only two declensions of adjectives, and they are named (perhaps a bit confusingly) **first/second** and **third** because of their resemblance to the paradigms for first, second, and third-declension nouns. Here are the charts for each:

### First/Second Declension Adjectives

Since adjectives can be any gender, I've listed these in order of masculine/feminine/neuter forms. Examples follow:

#### Singular

| Case              | Ending            | Example                       |
| :---              | :---              | :---                          |
| Nominative        | -us/-a/-um        | bonus/bona/bonum              |
| Genitive          | -i/-ae/-i         | boni/bonae/boni               |
| Dative            | -o/-ae/-i         | bono/bonae/bono               |
| Accusative        | -um/-am/-um       | bonum/bonam/bonum             |
| Ablative          | -o/-a/-o          | bono/bona/bono                |

#### Plural

| Case              | Ending            | Example                       |
| :---              | :---              | :---                          |
| Nominative        | -i/-ae/-a         | boni/bonae/bona               |
| Genitive          | -orum/-arum/-orum | bonorum/bonarum/bonorum       |
| Dative            | -is/-is/-is       | bonis/bonis/bonis             |
| Accusative        | -os/-as/-a        | bonos/bonas/bona              |
| Ablative          | -is/-is/-is       | bonis/bonis/bonis             |

### Third Declension Adjectives

Though there are three genders for third-declension adjectives, there are only two forms per adjective. The masculine and feminine are identical. As such, the forms in the following chart are given in order of masculine-feminine/neuter. Note that this does not mean that an adjective is simultaneously masculine *and* feminine!

Unlike nouns, there are no i-stem adjectives.

#### Singular

| Case              | Ending            | Example 1             | Example 2         | Example 3             |
| :---              | :---              | :---                  | :---              | :---                  |
| Nominative        | varies            | levis/leve            | ardens/ardens     | inferior/inferius     |
| Genitive          | -is/-is           | levis/levis           | ardentis/ardentis | inferioris/inferioris |
| Dative            | -i/-i             | levi/levi             | ardenti/ardenti   | inferiori/inferiori   |
| Accusative        | -em/same as nom.  | levis/leve            | ardentem/ardens   | inferiorem/inferius   |
| Ablative          | -e or -i          | levi/levi             | ardente/ardente   | inferiori/inferiori   |

#### Plural

| Case              | Ending            | Example 1             | Example 2             | Example 3                 |
| :---              | :---              | :---                  | :---                  | :---                      |
| Nominative        | -es/-ia or -a     | leves/levia           | ardentes/ardentia     | inferiores/inferiora      |
| Genitive          | -ium/-ium         | levium/levium         | ardentium/ardentium   | inferiorium/inferiorium   |
| Dative            | -ibus/-ibus       | levibus/levibus       | ardentibus/ardentibus | inferioribus/inferioribus |
| Accusative        | -es**/same as nom. | leves/levia          | ardentes/ardentia     | inferiores/inferiora      |
| Ablative          | -ibus/-ibus       | levibus/levibus       | ardentibus/ardentibus | inferioribus/inferioribus |

**: Sometimes the accusative plural for these adjectives ends in -is. This is rare.

{: .note}
> Latin adjectives have to agree with their nouns in gender, number, and case, but they do **not** have to agree in declension. As such, it's completely possible to have a first declension adjective with a fourth declension noun, a third declension adjective with a first declension noun, so on and so forth.

## Reflection Questions

1. Do you find that the case system makes it easier or harder to understand Latin nouns, and why?
2. Most Latin terminology in medical usage is comprised of nouns and some adjectives. Why do you think there are so few verbs?
3. Choose one of the phrases in the [Latin Phrases in Common Use](#latin-phrases-in-common-use) section. Identify each of the nouns. Then tell which case you think each of the nouns is, and why.
4. What do you notice in common between the declension paradigms between adjectives and nouns?
5. Choose any three of the Latin roots from this lesson. Look up and give their original Latin forms (you may refer to Wiktionary or Logeion for most accurate results&mdash; Google translate is not great for this). What gender and declension do they follow?
