# Project 1: Scientific Names 🐦
{: .no_toc}

## Objectives
{: .no_toc}

1. Apply knowledge of Greek and Latin roots to interpret scientific names
2. Understand how scientific names and common names are related (or not!)

## Relevance
{: .no_toc}

In this project, you will apply your understanding of bioscientific vocabulary by interpreting scientific names and matching them to the organisms they describe. Scientific names, often derived from Latin or Greek roots, convey essential information about the characteristics, habitat, or classification of an organism. By breaking down these names into their components, you can uncover their meanings and gain insights into the biology of each species. This project will enhance your ability to connect vocabulary with real-world applications in biology, reinforcing the foundational knowledge you've acquired in this course.

## Problem 1: Places, Please

Some organisms' species are derived from the places that they inhabit or were discovered in. Based on the names of these organisms, tell where they can be found. (Hint: They will look a lot like one part of the organism's name!)

1. Ursus americanus
2. Calopteryx japonica
3. Polytrichum ohioense
4. Passer italiae
5. Opuntia guatemalensis
6. Anguilla australis
7. Chrysaora africana
8. Rosa californica

## Problem 2: Order in the Court

Look up and provide the English name for each of the given orders. Give 1-2 examples of organisms in each order. Then, interpret the scientific names and explain why these make sense (or don't!) for the types of organisms they describe.

1. Lepidoptera
2. Coleoptera
3. Semaeostomae
4. Equisetales
5. Decapoda
6. Squamata
7. Carnivora
8. Actiniaria

## Problem 3: Appointment at the Genus Bar

You are given some lists of organisms that share a genus but differ in species. Match their scientific names to their English counterparts, then tell how you think the given species in this genus are differentiated from each other, from the following options:

* Use of original Latin and/or Greek terms
* Geographic names
* Discoverer names

(Hint: Look for words or syllables in common between the scientific and English names!)

### Problem 3.1: Panthera

| Scientific Name       | English Name          |
|:---                   | :---                  |
| 1. Panthera leo       | A. Jaguar             |
| 2. Panthera tigris    | B. Tiger              |
| 3. Panthera pardus    | C. Lion               |
| 4. Panthera onca      | D. Leopard            |

### Problem 3.2: Morpho

| Scientific Name       | English Name              |
|:---                   | :---                      |
| 1. Morpho sulkowskyi  | A. Richard's morpho       |
| 2. Morpho richardus   | B. Empress Eugenie morpho |
| 3. Morpho godarti     | C. Sulkowsky's morpho     |
| 4. Morpho eugenia     | D. Godart's morpho        |

### Problem 3.3: Lilium

| Scientific Name           | English Name              |
|:---                       | :---                      |
| 1. Lilium nepalense       | A. Michigan lily          |
| 2. Lilium michiganense    | B. Columbia tiger lily    |
| 3. Lilium washingtonianum | C. Lily of Nepal          |
| 4. Lilium columbianum     | D. Mt. Hood lily          |

## Problem 4: Mythological Names

Each of the following organisms has a scientific name related to a figure from Greek mythology. For each organism, look up and provide its English name. Then tell what figure from Greek mythology it's named after, and explain the connection between the figure and the organism in 1-2 sentences. You might find it helpful to include a brief description of both the figure and the organism. (It's OK to look up more information on the figures and organisms if you're not familiar with them!)

1. *Nestor notabilis*
2. *Dynastes hercules*
3. *Diomedea exulans*
4. *Narcissus poeticus*
5. *Argusianus argus*

## Problem 5: Dinosaurs

Here are some popular dinosaurs (and dinosaur-adjacent reptiles), along with the definitions of their names.

1. Velociraptor - speedy thief
2. Stegosaurus - roofed lizard
3. Tyrannosaurus - tyrant lizard
4. Triceratops - three-horned face
5. Utahraptor - thief from Utah
6. Protoceratops - first horned face
7. Iguanodon - iguana teeth
8. Apatosaurus - deceptive lizard
9. Ceratosaurus - horned lizard

Based on these definitions, write down what each of the following bases mean.

<ol type="A">
 <li>apato-</li>
 <li>-cerato-</li>
 <li>-odon</li>
 <li>-ops</li>
 <li>proto-</li>
 <li>-raptor</li>
 <li>-saurus</li>
 <li>stego-</li>
 <li>tri-</li>
 <li>veloci-</li>
</ol>

## Problem 6: What's in a Name?

For each of the organisms and their scientific names, provide a breakdown of all roots in the scientific name. Explain the meaning of each name based on its components, and give 1-2 sentences explaining why this name makes sense for the particular organism.

1. American flamingo (*phoenicopterus ruber*)
2. Mexican golden trout (*oncorhynchus chrysogaster*)
3. Western honey bee (*apis mellifera*)
4. Blacktip reef shark (*carcharhinus melanopterus*)
5. Five-needle pine tree (*pinus parviflora*)
6. Wood ear mushroom (*auricularia polytricha*)

## Challenge Problem: Ethnic names

While Greek and Latin roots form the backbone of much scientific terminology, non-Greek and Latin languages can also contribute to scientific names. For example, some plants and animals keep indigenous names to honor cultural heritage or reflect local knowledge about the species. Using non-Greek and Latin languages can provide specific, culturally relevant descriptors that might not be captured by traditional naming conventions.

For each of the following names, provide its English counterpart (i.e., its non-scientific, common name). Then, look up and provide the non-Latin or Greek language that is used in the scientific name. Then tell the significance (in at least 1-2 sentences) that the organism has to its culture of origin.

1. Opuntia tehuacana
2. Pouteria sapota
3. Akodon toba
4. Esox masquinongy
5. Sequoiadendron giganteum
